# Contributing to DocuMint

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We follow a simple workflow and small set of guidelines to keep the project healthy.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change: git checkout -b feat/short-description
3. Make small, focused commits. Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor).
4. Open a pull request describing the change.

## Code style

- Use ESLint rules already configured in the project.
- Keep changes minimal and add tests for new behavior when possible.

## Commit messages

Use conventional commit format. Example:

feat(transactions): add mock transaction model

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any console/network logs.
